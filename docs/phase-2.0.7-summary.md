# Phase 2.0.7 - Background Tracking Service (Integration)

## Overview

In this phase, we integrated the background tracking service with the UI application, allowing users to manage the Windows service from within the DueTime application. This provides a seamless experience for users who want continuous tracking even when the main application is closed.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Service Communication Layer**
   - Created `ServiceCommunication` utility class to interact with the Windows service
   - Implemented methods to install, uninstall, start, stop, and configure the service
   - Added proper error handling and logging

2. **Service Management UI**
   - Created `ServiceManagementView` with a user-friendly interface
   - Added status indicators and action buttons
   - Implemented confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

3. **Integration with Main Application**
   - Updated `MainWindow` to check for the running service at startup
   - Added menu item to access the service management screen
   - Prevented duplicate tracking when the service is already running

4. **Windows Service Implementation**
   - Created `TrackerService` class that inherits from `ServiceBase`
   - Implemented proper lifecycle methods (OnStart, OnStop, etc.)
   - Added file-based logging for service operations

5. **Installation Scripts**
   - Created `install-service.bat` for easy service installation
   - Created `uninstall-service.bat` for service removal
   - Added proper privilege checks and error handling

6. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with information about the background service
   - Added explanations about service benefits and management

## Technical Details

- The service uses the same tracking engine and database as the UI application
- Platform-specific code is properly handled with pragma directives
- The service can be run in console mode for debugging purposes
- The UI detects if the service is running and adjusts its behavior accordingly

## Next Steps

- Implement communication between the UI and the running service
- Add ability to pass configuration changes to the service
- Create a mechanism to view service logs from the UI
- Implement automatic service updates when the application is updated
